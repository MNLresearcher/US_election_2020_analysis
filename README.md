# US_election_2020_analysis

It's a straightforward process. First you need to have the 2020 election results from https://github.com/MNLresearcher/US_election_results_2020. Second you need the SORT_DIR folder, which you derive from the pummeler package.
After running the 'Datageneration.py' code, you execute the 'append_csv.py' code. This leaves you a folder with the required data for each state. In the end you have to simple choose the desired file, in which you want to apply the 'Multilogitmodel.py' code.
